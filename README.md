## App Info ℹ️

A simple but cool web app, helps users add quick note pins and modify older ones by editing/deleting them, where each pinned note includes a title, content, and a cool bg picker to choose your favorite color for your pin. Fully designed and developed by me! Built using Next.js while using both next.js native hooks and the awesome react hooks, in addition to Styling using the powerful SASS preprocessor, and used LocalStorage to persist data (users' notes).

## App Idea 💡

I've created this app on my free time as a side project. The idea came when I wanted to refresh my memory with using Array methods. So after a little time, I turned my litle chunck of code and self-memory-testing into this cool UI styled app. I tend to work on many side projects on my free time to keep a refreshed memory, while it's also a lot of fun! If you like what I do, hit me up & lets chat!
P.S. I've already built a similar app to this last year, but with a little less engaging UI, called "PINTASK". It was a task tracking app, which persists users tasks and store the data using a fake JSON server, with a temprorary backend hosted at Heroku, while the site itself was hosted (and still live) using Firebase. Check it out here [Pintask app](https://pintask-46374.web.app/).
