## App Info ℹ️

A simple but cool web app, helps users add quick note pins and modify older ones by editing/deleting them, where each pinned note includes a title, content, and a cool bg picker to choose your favorite color for your pin. Fully designed and developed by me! Built using Next.js while using both next.js native hooks and the awesome react hooks, in addition to Styling using the powerful SASS preprocessor, and used LocaolStorage to persist data (notes).

## App Idea 💡

I've created this app on my free time as a side project. The idea camewhen I already designed and worked on a similar project previously (last year), where that project was a task tracking app, which persists users tasks and store the data using a fake JSON server, with the temprorary backend hosted at Heroku, and the website itself hosted (and still live) using Firebase. Check it out here [Pintask app](https://pintask-46374.web.app/).
